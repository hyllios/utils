## NequIP-2FC Models

Here, you will find the models trained and their corresponding logs for TiNbTa and LiBC, as described in our article [1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad86a1/meta).  
The modified NequIP version for training on the force constants can be found in this [fork](https://github.com/Antoine-Loew/nequip).

The theory behind NequIP is described in the preprint [2]. NequIP's backend builds on **e3nn**, a general framework for building E(3)-equivariant neural networks [3]. If you use the fork or the models in this repository in your work, please consider citing NequIP-2FC [1], NequIP [2], and e3nn [4]:
