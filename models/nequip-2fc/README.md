## NequIP-2FC models

Here you will find the model trained and their corresponding log for TiNbTa and LiBC in our article [1]
The modified NequIP version to train on the force constant can be found in the [fork](https://github.com/Antoine-Loew/nequip).


## References & citing

The theory behind NequIP is described in the preprint (2). NequIP's backend builds on e3nn, a general framework for building E(3)-equivariant neural networks (3). If you use this repository in your work, please consider citing NequIP-2FC (1) NequIP (2) and e3nn (4):
